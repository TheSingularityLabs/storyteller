# 100 Layout Patterns for Scene Design

Comprehensive collection of layout patterns to ensure each scene has unique visual composition. Use different patterns for consecutive scenes to avoid repetition.

## How to Use This Guide

1. **Select by number** - Each pattern has a unique ID (1-100)
2. **Track usage** - Note which patterns you've used in adjacent scenes
3. **Mix categories** - Alternate between different categories for variety
4. **Adapt to content** - Choose patterns that support your narrative

## Pattern Selection Strategy

### For 12-Scene Explainer
Use at least 10 different categories to ensure variety.

### For 16-Scene Explainer
Mix categories throughout, never use same pattern twice.

### Selection Rules
1. **Never repeat adjacent patterns** - Choose from different categories
2. **Vary visual weight** - Alternate heavy/light compositions
3. **Mix symmetry and asymmetry** - Alternate balanced/dynamic
4. **Consider narrative flow** - Pattern should support story beat
5. **Track usage** - Note pattern IDs used in your explainer

### Example Pattern Sequence (16 scenes)
Scene 0: #46 (Circular Orbit)
Scene 1: #2 (Left-Heavy Asymmetric)
Scene 2: #31 (Diagonal Cascade)
Scene 3: #76 (Before/After Split)
Scene 4: #50 (Radial Expansion)
Scene 5: #17 (Vertical 30/70)
Scene 6: #89 (Hub-and-Spoke)
Scene 7: #61 (Four-Quadrant)
Scene 8: #41 (Wave Pattern)
Scene 9: #70 (L-Shaped Grid)
Scene 10: #96 (Scattered Constellation)
Scene 11: #33 (Ascending Diagonal)
Scene 12: #78 (Diagonal Before/After)
Scene 13: #95 (Venn Overlap)
Scene 14: #86 (Timeline Journey)
Scene 15: #50 (Radial Expansion - callback to Scene 4 for closure)

### Quick Reference by Category
- **Asymmetric**: 1-15 (Dynamic, unbalanced)
- **Split**: 16-30 (Clean divisions)
- **Diagonal/Dynamic**: 31-45 (Movement, energy)
- **Circular/Radial**: 46-60 (Orbits, expansion)
- **Grid/Structured**: 61-75 (Organized, ordered)
- **Comparison**: 76-85 (Contrasts, before/after)
- **Specialty**: 86-100 (Unique, complex)

## Visual Weight Distribution Guide

### Light Layouts (Breathing Room)
2, 7, 14, 19, 24, 56, 73, 83, 96, 100

### Medium Layouts (Balanced)
16, 21, 25, 51, 61, 65, 76, 86, 89, 95

### Heavy Layouts (Information Dense)
1, 9, 48, 49, 62, 66, 74, 90, 97, 99

## Pattern Pairing Suggestions

**Good Pairs** (Contrasting Energy):
- Asymmetric (#1-15) → Grid (#61-75)
- Circular (#46-60) → Diagonal (#31-45)
- Comparison (#76-85) → Radial (#46-60)
- Split (#16-30) → Specialty (#86-100)

**Avoid Pairs** (Too Similar):
- Don't pair two asymmetrics back-to-back
- Don't pair two diagonals in same direction
- Don't pair two grids consecutively
- Don't pair two orbits in a row

---

## Category-Based Random Selection

When unsure which pattern to use, randomly select from these pools based on scene type:

**Opening/Closing Scenes**: #46, #50, #51, #60, #89, #95
**Problem Scenes**: #1, #2, #46, #76, #77, #83
**Discovery Scenes**: #31, #33, #50, #56, #92, #96
**Solution Scenes**: #17, #61, #70, #89, #90, #93
**Impact Scenes**: #42, #50, #86, #87, #91, #100
